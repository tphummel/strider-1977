I got off at mid-morning with my new, funny friends and hiked well at a good pace the 18 miles to Skyline Ranch, a beautiful place, sitting dead center in the Kelso Valley and right below the Piute Mountains. They will soon have a small store, campgrounds, recreation galore and they even have an airport now. Chuck Below owns it with his wife and four kids. Really a nice guy and a beautiful place and I sure would like to go back and enjoy it fully.
