The flies have replaced the mosquitoes and they are almost as bad. Biting too!! 11 miles to lunch below impressive glacier cut Mt. Adams on the “Round the Mountain Trail”. Water for lunch is putrid orange color from glacial wash. Around Adams all day and had trouble crossing some of the glacial rivers. Camped at real nice spot on Killen Creek. Beautiful view of both Adams and 50 mile distant Rainier. 2 cascades here with wild flowers, meadows, etc. Come back here! Gorgeous sunset!
