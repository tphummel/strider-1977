Paul (Hacker) and Sjoeke showed up last night with the Truckers. This morning I woke up to find heavy frost on everything, and heavy cloud cover blowing in on a very cold wind. Packed up and out as fast as possible and hiked with the Truckers in morning and the Blazers in the afternoon. The sun showed for a few hours during lunch and so we dried things out. My pack is pulling apart at the main pocket. I will try to fix it tonight but try to get a new one from Eddie Bauer on the guarantee. 7,650 feet (elevation) last night, 9,000 feet tonight at Burrwood Meadow. My heel’s still really bugging me. Low cloud cover and really cold winds now. Met up with Nancy from Pennsylvania this evening and am camped with her and Blazers. CCCOOLLD!!!(Nancy’s trailname was “Mile-a-Minute” which referred to her mouth more than her hiking pace!)
