Woke up not feeling too hot; a combination hang over and the runs!! Said probable final goodbyes to Steve and Tom and went on my way down or rather north on Hwy 89. I’d like to get together with these guys after the hike is over. They’re great guys. It turns out that the Swiss Army knife I found belongs to Joe. Walked about 15 miles feeling weak so I stopped at Dickson Flat about 40 miles from Hwy 5. No water here thought so I hitchhiked up and back from a stream 5 miles down the road in 2 quick rides. I talked to the parents last night and everything seems well. I am skipping my Seiad Valley food drop by going up Hwy 5 so I’m having the parents send some food and the Oregon-Washington guide book to Hornbrook, right near the Ore-Calif. Border. This is the first birthday that I have spent alone and it’s my 21st!! The way I look at it, it is a special B-day and by spending it alone it’s mine, mine, mine, all mine! But then I have no one to share this day with and that makes me sad. (The day was a beautiful one, perfect blue skies, hot and clear. Mt. Shasta poked up above the forests that lined the highway directly ahead. At one point a van stopped to offer me a ride and I refused, telling them that I was walking and wanted to keep walking. So they gave me a cold beer on a hot afternoon!)
