Slept like a rock cause I was so tired but felt good in the morning. Met Jim again about 10 miles down the road and we hiked to Fire Mountain Resort for lunch. He camped 3 miles south of me last night and doesn’t want to go as far as I do today so it’s goodbye. He gave me his compass cause he’s going home in a couple days and then back to the Air Force. Jim Beaty, a true friend. God damn if I didn’t miss the turnoff because it’s wrong in the guide book so I kept going to an alternate route I could take but I made a wrong turn again! No luck. I met a rancher in a truck and so he took me back to my mistake and set me straight. By the time I got to Spencer Meadows the sun was almost down and I barely had enough time to cook dinner, set up my tent and fight off the mosquitoes. No water again so for the second night in a row I had to purify water from the meadow. (To purify I first collected a pot of the cleanest water I could find and dropped in an iodine tablet. I stirred this until fully dissolved and then strained the water through my bandana. I then would boil the water fully before using it to cook my meal.) No fun again today but I did find a stuff sack and deer are very abundant.
