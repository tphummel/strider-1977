Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful day. Bright blue skies and warm, warm sun all day long. Join that with the green beauty of the southern Sequoia – Sierra and you will get an inkling of this day. 14 miles to Beach Meadows, a pretty easy walk but God I’m hungry. The true Sierra at last after 600 miles and nearly five weeks. Moon’s been full fro the last few days.
