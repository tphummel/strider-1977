It actually never really rained hard on us today as we hiked 18 miles to Sally Ann Lake. The sun shined thru holes in the cloud cover all day. Itâ€™s the best weather in a week despite the heavy mist, fog, wind, mud and wet everything. I have to wear rain chaps all day to keep my legs dry; my boots have been soaking wet since Snoqualmie Pass mainly from the low bushes.
