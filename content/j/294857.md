Jeff is hitching into Yakima to get his boots fixed so it’s farewell to him since it would be nearly impossible for him to catch us again. (Jeff, Paul and I have been good friends ever since) But Paul & I are off again and the weather is trying to decide to rain or not. A long drop from over 4,000’ down to 1620’ and then a long climb up to over 4,000’ again today before camping below Dutch Miller Gap at Pedro Camp. 21.3 miles.
