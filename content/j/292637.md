It rained and snowed last night but very little. It did the same all day long and the wind, a very cold wind, has blown hard all day too. The Unfortunates are leaving tomorrow, the Blazers are leaving when the weather clears up and I am going to leave in 3 days with Paul & Sjoeke who I saw today. This morning we went over to a dumpster behind a Safeway market and got a ton of day old bread, rolls, coffee cakes and slightly damaged cans of food. We can never possibly eat it all. My muscles were tight and sore but we went over to the highschool here this afternoon and played 3 on 3 basketball on the outdoor courts. It was a lot of fun but it rained and snowed on us. Everybody is going to the gym tonight to play volleyball but I’m not sure I’ll go cause my stomach is really upset (probably from the dumpster diving!). I haven’t eaten any of the food out of the dumpster yet, so it’s not that.(My plans to hike with Paul Hacker and Sjoeke at this point show that Paul and I already shared a common thread that was to develop more in the hike and also in future years.)
