Up late and slow. The first thing I did was swim in the river. Wrote letters all morning, and went over to the P.O. and mailed everything and picked up another letter for me. I got news that I will be getting $400 per quarter next year for basketball and that the parents are willing to drive up and meet me in Manning Park. Both are great! Swam a few times more and then took off around mid-afternoon after Jim up to a small cabin halfway back up out of this canyon and right on a rushing creek, Chips Creek. Only 5 miles but over 1,000 feet in the first 1 ½ miles. Neat little place, owned, stocked and maintained by “Rex” who allows it to be used by anyone. Did a little fishing but no luck. One of those letters I wrote that morning: Hi, I was going to write Tom (Morgan, co-high school basketball friend) but I realized I don’t have his address so I didn’t want to waste a card. I’m feeling very, very strong. I did 25 miles one day in 90-degree weather and felt fine. How was your vacation? Mine is going just fine, except too hot and not enough water. I’m over half way! The parents are going to pick me up at the border. Why don’t you go along? . . . (Censored!) Love, Greg.
