Another beautiful spring/summer day as we hiked over a ridge and out of sight of the buttes. All the little wildflowers are so dainty and delicate. Matt is doing O.K. so we got to Oakland Pond for a swim, lunch, and a few minutes of Frisbee. The swim was extremely refreshing. We hiked most of the day on dirt logging & mining roads and so our feet finally gave out at the Johnsonville-Gibsonville road at a campground and so we docked it for the day. Matt has decided he doesn’t have enough food to go to Belden so tomorrow he’s going to head back and pick up some fishing in the many lakes we passed today. Fred has also decided to go with him cause he can get a ride with Matt back to Tahoe to his van and also cause it will make my food, gas and mileage situation a lot better. I’m not too happy about Fred leaving but its his decision and he wants to come in again later anyway. Had a good, big farewell dinner and hit the sack.
