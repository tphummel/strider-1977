Up early and into Gov’t Camp before noon.   Met Jeff Zimmerman there, a fellow P.C.T.er who has been ahead of us by a week for quite a while. Got my food package but no money! Prey it comes tomorrow. I got my lightweight boots finally also, YEAH! Sat around all afternoon and BS’ed with Jeff and locals. Camped by a stream just across form the P.O.   (I took a well-needed bath in this ccccoooolllldddd creek in the warm afternoon sun and washed several weeks of trail dust and smells off.   The life of a long distance hiker is one of dirt and smells that few others in our society can stand. Thus when hitchhiking a thru-hiker is often barely tolerated as the smell of accumulated dirt; sweat, excrement, etc. can be unbelievable.)
