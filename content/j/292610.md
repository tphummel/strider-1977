Only 26 miles to Weldon by an alternate road so Iâ€™m taking it, Lee and trio took a long time to decide to also, so away we go. We found some Indian hieroglyphics on a rock that Chuck told us about. Later that day we walked through a ghost town of 100 years with abandoned mines, no buildings, but a hanging tree. We staged a picture of hanging Lee by having him stand on my shoulders. Had a lot of fun and joking with these guys. We camped down by the Kelso Creek in an area prepared by some people who own the land. Shady trees, tables, etc. 13 miles to Weldon.
