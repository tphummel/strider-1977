Walked up the Arnot Creek Trail on semi-dirt roads being chased by thunder clouds all the way. Jay’s feet are really bad but he walks anyway. I’ve got the runs, so we make a pair. It rained on us just before Highland Lakes and lunch after a 2,00’ climb. Fished the lake at lunch but no luck. I’m getting better at cribbage & beating Jay occasionally now at our lunchly game. Took our time to Highway 4 and nearly killed ourselves on another of our “shortcuts”. Up to Ebbets Pass to find a newly completed section of permanent P.C.T. so we set up camp and had dinner just before the rain set in again! The new trail saves a lot of useless climbing. The rain is coming down!
