I re-supplied breakfasts and lunches this morning and discovered that I have twice as many dinners as I need to get me to Big Bear (my first mail supply point), so it’s scarf time! Hiked right along Interstate 10 today from Cabazon to Whitewater Canyon. I dropped in on Katherine McKenzie, an old lady that Mike Ross said was really nice. She really was as she fed me fresh strawberries, pineapple upsidedown cake, milk, etc.. We talked awhile about her owning the canyon and things and then she took my picture. She will send it to Mike. She lived in a true adobe house. The walls were about three feet thick. The day I walked up Whitewater canyon was easily 90 degrees in the shade. As I passed through her front door the temperature dropped at least 20 degrees! Mike had met her on his hike in 1975 and wrote her to expect me. I continued on up the canyon and have camped just north of the trout hatchery.   Very hot in desert today. Went by the lowest point on the PCT in California: 1,185 feet.
