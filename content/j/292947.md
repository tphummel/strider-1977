Down Rockbound Valley thru some bad bogs and big rocks. After lunch we found a place where the Rubicon River ran over really smooth rocks so we stripped down and slid down despite the freezing cold water but hot, bright, sun warmed us up quick. Both Fred and I soaked our feet later crossing the river lower down. We camped right above over-looking Rockbound Lake. Beautiful sunset. This, due to the smoky skies from all of the forest fires in this driest of years. (This night we heard some very loud explosion-like sounds, almost like dynamite going off. The wind was only blowing lightly yet, the next day, we came across several large trees freshly tumbled over the trail with the fresh, new growth of Spring evident on their bows.)
