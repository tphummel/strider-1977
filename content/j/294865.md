No rain, so off we go and immediately climb up the 3,000 feet we dropped the day before last. Over Fire Creek Pass to find big patches of blue sky, thank God, and our first good views of some of the Nth Cascades. Kennedy Peak for one, Glacier Peak is hidden but close. Past a solid frozen Mica Lake before lunch and then dropped to Milk Creek before climbing up 2,000 feet to camp. The weather still looks unstable. (On this day we climbed up the 3,000 feet to Fire Creek Pass, then dropped another 3,000 feet to Milk Creek. While switch backing down this steep, deeply green, lush, forested ridge, we notice the switch backs coming up the side of the next ridge across from us. In these situation we would curse the trail builders, who designed a trail that didnâ€™t maintain elevation but just went stupidly up and down ridge after ridge.) Raining all night.
