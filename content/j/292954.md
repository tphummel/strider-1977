Sunshine thru the overcast so nothing much dried out. Down to Sierra City which sits in the shadow of the impressive Sierra Buttes. Just sat around waiting for Matt and filling in supplies. A really neat little town and the wildflowers are incredible. Sat around until 5:30 and then hiked back to Wild Plum Campground and camped by the North Yuba River just outside the camp. Fred and I found an incredible piece of land once built on but now gone, in a very secretive, secluded place.   Absolutely beautiful, everything!
