The first half of the day was O.K., but I really didn’t enjoy the second as we walked through in-progress clear-cutting. It really stunned me and shocked me at the absolute and total destruction of the forest. Sick, sick!! It’s really very depressing. They own the land that the trail is on in places so when they clear cut they detour the trail until they are done and then they clear off the original of all the debris and it then is on desolate land. Camped at Tacoma Pass
