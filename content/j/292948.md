The weather continues to be excellent so we took off around Buck Island Lake Reservoir and dropped down really rough jeep trails to cross a very deep, slow moving river with over-abundant fish in it. Just like an aquarium, we watched as these 10” to 15” trout swim by. I caught a 10 incher and then nothing for 2 hours til we left. Some steep, steep climbing, through Barker Meadows and then onto the Powderhorn Trail over a pass and down to Powderhorn Creek for camp tonight. Fred’s feet have just a couple blisters and his muscles are pretty sore but he’s getting there fast.
