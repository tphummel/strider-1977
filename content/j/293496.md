The dew soaked everything so it took a while to get away. N605 to N60 and then back on the PCT to Junction Lake to camp; about 15 miles. Met 3 people hiking just Washington Nth to Sth. Sounds like we have real good scenery ahead. A beautiful day but mostly forest walking. Mt. Adams, Rainier and St. Helens are all in view.
