Up early so we could walk the 10 miles or so to Whites Pass before the P.O. closes as this is Saturday. Walked to a chair lift directly 2,000 ft. above the pass and took it down just for fun. Picked up my food along with 2 packages from J & Beth and 1 from Lori plus 4 letters from the same party and lots of other mail. It’s really nice. Camped here at Leech Lake and shared a campsite with truck driving, train hoping, rambling, bow legged, 125 lb. pack – 50 mile-a-day, love-a-duck, Texan and his wife. Crazy!    (This guy tried to convince me that with a 125 lb. pack, in his cowboy boots that he could out hike me in a 50-mile day! I laughed at him knowing the huge blisters that he would get just from carrying such a weight for a short while, and knowing that 50 miles is a distance that few men have ever traveled on foot in a single day, running with nothing on their backs, let alone a 50 lb. pack. He had just a bit too much bravado and ego for me and was so stubborn that he wouldn’t even listen to one who was “walking the walk”.)
