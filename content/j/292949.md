Down the canyon past many people probably because schools are getting out and then up to Whiskey Creek Camp for a complete body and clothes wash and lunch. The Kelty Kids came in just before we left. Good to see them again. (They always brought a light-hearted joking and jiving attitude to every decision, every conversation.) Up over Emigrant Pass with vistas back to Tahoe Lake again and Squaw Valley. Dropping over a ridge and down into a privately owned valley to camp tonight. Beautiful valley but NO TRESPASSING, NO HUNTING, NO FISHING signs everywhere ruin it. Got our dinner just down when lightning and thunder directly overhead and then whoosh, down came the rain for a couple hours. Tried to celebrate my 1,000 mile mark but the rain ruined it.
