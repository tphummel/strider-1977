Well, as usual the forecast was wrong. In the middle of the night I awoke to feel rain on my face so we hurriedly pitched our 2 tents and jumped in and before long it really came down. Stopped just in time for breakfast though. ( . . . hints of what was to come.) The undergrowth is thick around the trail so it thoroughly soaks your legs. Later on it was over my head in places so we put on our full rain gear. Only 10 miles and we are in Snoqualmie Pass. We got some groceries and the Jeff got us a small room at a Ski resort there. Spent the afternoon playing cards, reading and watching the rain. We found a large room with 2 double beds open so we were a LOT more comfortable.
