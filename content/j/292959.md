Up early and to both of our surprise we saw a light colored bear spying on us. A few deer also this morning. We went through a badly logged area to get to and drop down to the middle fork of the Feather River and Hartman Bar. A huge pool with a nice footbridge across it. Stayed there for lunch and took a cool swim in the heat. A nice campground and even a beach. (In the woods surrounding this were old logging blades and equipment rusting away. Huge fern groves lined the ridge that we dropped down.) A hot, dry, long, sweaty climb out and up, up and then trudged through a maze of trails, logging roads and public roads to Bucks Lake for 25 or 26 mile day. Stayed in a P.G. & E. campground and Jim came in a while before sundown. (Many times in the hike I would start off after lunch with a partner and by the time I got to where we planned to camp, I would be a mile or more ahead of them, a function of my long legs, long stride and relative fast pace.)
