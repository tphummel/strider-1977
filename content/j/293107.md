Up and down the trail through fields of wild flowers and passed at least 30 people packing in. Strange after seeing so few yesterday. Lunch at Minnie Scott spring and then across lava beds to McKenzie Pass and Lava Lake Camp for the night. A few families there just picnicking. Swimming is good.   Late afternoon three high school students pulled up in a camper after everyone had left. They asked me if I had any beer and I said no, but if they could feed me I’d buy for them at the closest settlement. So away we went into Sisters, Oregon, a neat little town and bought a case and a half for four of us. This guy had lots of bucks. Needless to say, we got wasted and I ate my fill in hot dogs and turkey and cheese sandwiches
