I’m on the road again and “Mile-a-minute”, Nancy got out of a car to walk to Burney with me. Burney had just had a 4th of July parade and in the process of rodeos, baseball games and etc. Hot, hot while we walked around looking for the Unfortunates and trying to enjoy this redneck town. No luck finding them after looking all afternoon so we camped behind a school and took it easy all evening. Paul Hacker is supposedly right behind us. (At one point while walking with Nancy here we were walking in light mud and she noticed that she took three steps for every two of mine. This prompted us to try to calculate the number of steps that I took and she did. “Let’s see; 2,500 miles times 5,260 feet per mile . . . is . . . doing all of this in our heads as we walked . . . is . . . 13 million, 150 thousand feet, then divide by 3 is . . . 4 million 383 thousand steps for me! Divide by two is . . . 6 million, 575 thousand steps for Nancy! Meaning that I would take about 2 million fewer steps on this trek than her!!! This made her really mad until I pointed out that I was carrying about 50% more body weight and pack weight than she was.)
