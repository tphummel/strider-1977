We organized the packs last night so we could get off early this morning so we could get to Muir Camp early to make sure we could get space in a cabin there. Only 4 miles there but 4500’ up all on snow fields. Nothing hard except hard steep walking. It took us about 3 or 4 hours and when we got there we found about 30 to 40 people there in a 5 day mountaineering class. Fortunately they have a separate cabin and there is also a tiny cabin for a ranger stationed there. This is the taking off point for summit attempts and there is a sign saying “No one beyond this point without a permit.” Laid in sun all afternoon and just took in the view of Adams, St. Helens and the Tatoosh Range and Goat Rocks in the fore ground. Slept in the afternoon while people began to arrive. By sun down there was probably 25 people crammed into this supposed 35-person capacity bunk cabin.    Packs, equipment, cooking food, mice and mass cramming occupied the night, and sleep was scarce.(While we roamed around that afternoon, we went over to the glacier right next to the cabin and were stunned by the width, depth and intimidation of the crevasses that the trail in the ice crossed. We asked ourselves, "and we're going to cross those in the dark?!!!")
