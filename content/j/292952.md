Woke up real early with the sun and Fred and I encouraged Nancy to see a doctor on account that she has a terrible cough (perhaps from talking to much?!). We took off and hiked cross-country to the nearest lake for breakfast. Then some hard bush-bashing to get to Highway 80 and on up to Paradise Valley for lunch and a game of backgammon. Fred’s knee is still bugging him and Nancy caught us at lunch. Us 3 hiked on and on dirt roads all afternoon and ended up at Meadow Lake, camped on the “beach” left by the low water level (again, a sign of the extreme dryness of that year). Just after lunch we climbed up over a prominent ridge and right at the summit a volcanic rock extrusion stuck out on a point like a castle. We dropped our packs and climbed atop to see the view and to look closer at a beautiful tree we could barely see from below.   There were two trees on top, both Bristle Cone (Not likely this far north, but then?). One was perfectly symmetrical and an absolute work of art by the hand of nature. Exquisite. Must get back to this place someday. (Just one of many!) Litter everywhere though. Bumsher Meadow Lake infested with knats but nice looking. Got rain in the evening.
