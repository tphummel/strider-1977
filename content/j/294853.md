Hot & dry? That’s all it’s been since the gorge and today is no exception. A nice walk throughout the day as we pass to the east and leave behind Mt. Tahoma. The Nth Cascades jagged edge appears in the afternoon ahead. 23.5 miles to Government Meadow for the night. Met a few middle aged couples from the “Trails Club of Oregon” who have hiked from Whites Pass. A member of their club supposedly got interest restarted in the P.C.T. so that it was included in the Nat. Scenic Trails Act. (According to my understanding of the history of the trail, Clinton C. Clarke’s book; “The Pacific Crest Trailway” was intended to interest Congress in the PCT being included and it and he was in fact THE instrumental tools in accomplishing this.) My feet are killing me but no bad blisters. A strange phenomenon that we have encountered since Nth Calif continues to plague us; spider webs made by quite large spiders span the trail whenever it hasn’t been traveled in a while. So, the first person thru is constantly enraged by the incessant strings stretched across his face, arms and legs. It shows the low usage of the trail in places. (Two years to the day before I married Laurie! Little did I know what this day would mean to me for the rest of my life?)
