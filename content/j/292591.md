Last night was pretty warm and I slept real well. Of course, the steak and baked potatoes helped a little. John from Illinois and I barbecued and had a real good meal. I got up, packed and went to the Post Office to wait for it to open so I could send two canisters of gas on to Acton. Well I waited and waited and Post Office opened and close and still no word or sign of Rick Toczek so I said to hell with it and left. I haven’t heard from him in three weeks. He has made little effort toward communicating with me and he couldn’t go my pace anyway, so? I hiked 12 to 15 miles in spite of my waiting and am comfortably camped at Big Pine Flats. Another beautiful day today, but my Achilles tendon is bugging me. We’ll see. I don’t believe that I ever heard from Rick again.
