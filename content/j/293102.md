The British couple, Graham and Barbara, arrived today and so we celebrated with a case of beer, which we sat around and drank in the hot sun. My food package came but my boots failed to arrive so I gave the parents a call. They were confused by Sjoeke’s call and so they weren’t sent. My present pair will have to hold up for another 200 miles to Government Camp. Good luck!   Had a good evening campfire talk with the English couple. As we were sitting around clouds in the east began to lightning and thunder and so we prepared ourselves for rain tonight.
