No packages when the P.O. opened this morning but mine from the parents came later with the delivery. No Oregon-Washington Guidebook though!! Paul has one so Iâ€™ll probably stick with him until I get mine. Got out of town around 1:30 in 95 degrees and sweated buckets until we decided it was too hot to refuse a ride to Irongate Reservoir. Went swimming, ate lunch and slept until the heat subsided & then went on to Camp Creek. Oregon tomorrow!!!
