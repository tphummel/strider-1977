Pancakes for breakfast and down to Old Soda Springs and then on dirt roads all the way to Soda Springs for lunch. Fred’s knee is hurting him so we’re taking it easy. His pack broke also in the belly band but he fixed it. The Kelty Kids here and there all yesterday and today and then Nancy and four new P.C.T.ers; the “Lightweights” met us at Soda Springs. (I do not remember these hikers as I do all of the rest. They must have only hiked a short section and not run into too many other of the ‘77’ers.) Hiked with Nancy up the road and missed our turn off. Looking lost we were urged into a Ski resort by the owner, Norm Saylor, and offered a meal, shower, and bed for the night near Donner Pass. The employees live and play there during the off season and they were just really nice and hospitable. We had a “traveler’s special” dinner and washed our clothes, took showers, and then went to bed on beds in a dormitory. We have to cross-country tomorrow to get back onto the trail.
