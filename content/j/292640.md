Got up and out by 8:00 and stopped by Devil’s Postpile National Monument. We came to quite a deep and wide creek just a few miles up the trail and couldn’t find a way to cross. Joe went half way across on a log and lost his balance and gave us all a lesson in underwater backpacking. He got thoroughly soaked and everybody laughed even though it wasn’t too funny cause the wind was blowing real cold. He changed his clothes and we were on our way again. It started off a beautiful day but we knew it couldn’t last since a storm is expected today. It came about noon but didn’t drop very much all day. We got to Shadow Lake and it is really beautiful with the snow and no people. Had lunch there and then went on to Garnet and 1000 Island Lakes, which are both frozen over.    Camped at 1000 Island Lake tonight and, as usual the wind is blowing a cold war. The clouds are covering Banner Peak so no good pictures tonight with all the ice and snow around. Maybe tomorrow morning. It’s a real pleasure hiking with the Unfortunates.
