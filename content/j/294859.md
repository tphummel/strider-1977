Rained throughout the night so we are both carrying about 5 extra pounds of water in our tents (and clothes, and shoes and socks and gear). Over two low but steep and hard passes and thru wet bushes. Feet are constantly soaked even though it didn’t rain through solid from lunch on and really made the walking tough in the mud. We met Rob right as we came off the trail at Stevens Pass and he took us down to a campground (Money Creek) just below Skykomish. Still raining during dinner though we didn’t seem to notice as we devoured steak, corn and beer, Rob has brought us.
