Walked up to Fish Lake Resort for lunch thru green forests but still on road. On Hwy 140 to Cascade Canal and on trail for the first time since way back at Lassen. Nice, well maintained trail, up past Mt. McLoughlin and into the Sky Lakes Wilderness and mosquitoes galore. Camped at Summit Lake up the trail from 4-mile Lake, threw up our tents and escaped the mossies. The Hwys in Oregon that we have walked on have very, very little liter, if any at all in stretches. It seems that the 5-cent return on all beverage cans is working well. We even found a few & cashed in. (Since this time California enacted a similar law and similarly eliminated most of the bottles and cans that littered the highways in the past.)
