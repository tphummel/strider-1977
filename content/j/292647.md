Jay got his food last night packed up and left after I took Lori (Laurie) to the airport. We went to breakfast at a restaurant where Elena Deciutus (a highschool friend of Fred’s) works and talked with her while we ate. She’s looking fine. (Ha, every woman looks good to a young man who has been out in the woods too long!) We then slowly put-putted our way up to Yosemite in Fred’s classic VW bus. With a lot of hassle I got my mail packages and money, paid off the rangers (who had loaned me money), bought some food and then started off again for Toulumne Meadows. Fred dropped us off at the trail head and agreed to meet us at South Lake Tahoe on the 12th. (Toulumne to Sth Lake Tahoe in 10 days is still considered to be relatively fast)
