I got up and headed for the town of Mojave and arrived at around noon, a good 13 miles of dirt road walking. I’m camped in a county park and was treated to a girl’s softball little league game in the baseball diamond here.   The wind again started out a breeze this morning and graduated into gale force this afternoon. If I don’t get into the Sierras soon I think I’ll go nuts. In the desert, since the scenery is nill you have nothing to keep your attention so it focuses on things like my hurting feet or an uncomfortable pad. I dreamt I was bit bv a rattlesnake on my arm and when I woke up I found my arm was pinned under me and totally asleep tingling. I here from others here that Water may be scarce from here to Weldon, but we’ll see.
