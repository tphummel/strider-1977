I did about 20 miles today and got into a camp at a roadside picnic area around 2:00. A typical day starts at dawn, probably about 6:00 or so (as I didn’t carry a watch, intentionally) and breakfast and breaking camp happens a bit concurrently so by 6:30 I’m walking. At 3+ miles per hour pace, it only takes about 7 hours to go 20 miles, so by about 2:00 in the afternoon I’m at that point where I can quit if I want to, or it is convenient to water, or my blisters are killing me, or, or, but I can also go on to a more convenient spot to camp and still have plenty of light left in the day. I sat around and read most of the afternoon away. A Dodge van pulled in that was overheating and got some water. A real nice man, works for Rockwell. He gave me some canned food when he learned I was a little short on food.
