Well here I am back at the work site all by myself n the trailer and very tired. Try walking 6 miles in two feet of snow with 60 lbs. on your back, at 9,000 feet elevation, after laying in bed for 3 days straight. Needless to say I hurt. I also lost the trail and went up a wrong canyon until I hit a road and if it hadn’t been for some lumberjacks driving by I’d probably still be going the wrong way on the road. So it didn’t faze me when I finally did reach the trailers to remove a window to get inside since they were locked. I stopped at Casa Vieja Ranger station to find no one there but the building open. So I picked up a map, a bunch of matches and other miscellaneous things. I saw the first PCT’ers in 6 days. The Kelty Kids it turns out were camped a ¼ mile further back than I walked yesterday. Have you ever seen a snow covered forest begin to melt. First the snow underfoot begins to get sloshy. Then the snow that has gathered upon the branches begins to slip off, falling in showers and cascades of white and then creating divots and holes in the once perfect blanket of snow as it strikes the ground.
