Fred came by about 9:00 and took me to Amanda’s for a terrific breakfast. Another beautiful day, at least 80-85 degrees, so we, F & M & I went up to a park and threw the Frisbee, had lunch & beer and just soaked up the rays. In the evening went to Amanda’s sat around & enjoyed the evening while Fred left for work. Mandy and I then later on, went with one of here roommates, Paul, and his friend, to the Mariner. Fred served us just about everything possible and when we left I could barely fit my smile and stomach through the front door! (This is really saying something as to feed the incredible appetite of a thru-hiker is nearly impossible with the massive amount of calories that one burns everyday hiking. At many times during the hike I made my hosts rather sick with the amount of food that I would consume at a sitting.)
