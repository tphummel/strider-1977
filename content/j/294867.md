Good day sunshine and September. Clear again as we slowly dropped down a long glacial valley to High Bridge and the road into Stehekin. Caught a shuttle bus that runs this road into Stehekin on Lake Chelan. Sitting at very low altitude here looking back up into the Cascades. Camped at Purple Point Campground and will pick up food from the store and mail tomorrow.(Our recovered register entries say, "HOT DAMN! H&H Inc. (Hummel & Hacker) are here and only 6 days to go! I'm glad and sad it is all coming to an end. A last farewell to all of you border to border's. Unfortunates, Bombers, Backtrackers, Trailblazers, Kelty Kids, and all of you I never met. I hope all is well for all. 9 days of rain straight! StriderIt is with mixed feelings that I approach the end of this trip. All the happiness and depressions of a life time compressed into 6 months. "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times". My faith in humanity is restored. We can make it. Good luck to all, wish you all success in any future endeavors. Paul Hacker)
