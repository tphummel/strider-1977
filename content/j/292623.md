It snowed about 2 inches last night and was still coming down when I woke. I left anyway and got to Casa Vieja Ranger St. for lunch. It really came down for a while during and after lunch on my way to Long Canyon Mdw. I hiked or rather plodded thru the snow for a couple miles up Long Canyon past where I stayed those 3 days. I set up my tent in snow both falling and a foot on the ground. Iâ€™m nice and warm and since eating dinner I have discovered the advantage to carrying canned food. Yum Yum. Damn heavy though!
