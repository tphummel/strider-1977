It rained last night & this morning and it doesn’t look like it’s going to break soon. (handwritten by Laurie in margin “On April 24, 1977 a note to say I love you, me) We packed up wet and off we went dropping way down a couple thousand feet and then climbing back up again. A new section of trail from Cathedral Pass to Deception Pass cut off 5 miles and enabled us to get over that last pass and to 17-mile-camp; 17 miles from Stevens Pass. Paul’s cousin, Rob, will meet us there tomorrow with steaks and beer so we want to make sure we get there. It rained sold from noon on into the night and made camping a mess. It has rained on us for the 3rd day in a row.
