No rain and a big beautiful blue sky this morning. Saw a few Labor Day Weekenders coming in as we got close to Harts Pass. We found a note for me from Carol of my speech class from Santa Barbara who I saw earlier at Mt. Rainier (she recognized me on the day we came off the mountain as we came back into Paradise Lodge, “Greg!”, who in hell would know me there?? She knew I was walking the trail, but was flabbergasted to learn that I had, in fact, walked all the way there). She congratulated me and wished me well. She had been hiking in the area earlier. At Harts Pass another coincidence occurred when a guy in a car pulled up and asked us if we had heard of some guy named “Strider”? It turns out he met the Blazers and Chairman at Janice Lake a day after we were there. Lunch below Foggy Pass and then on to Shaw Creek for camp. It flows into the Pasayten River and its incredible valley. A deer kept invading our camp tonight. (Either we camped in his nightly spot, or, more likely he smelled the crusted salt on our packs and came seeking out a salt lick, full rack, VERY intimidating!) “Don’t let me die with my boots on” Paul D. Hacker, 1977.
