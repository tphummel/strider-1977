Happy Birthday, Lynn! (my sister) Walked up the road to Olallie Lake for a late morning feast on donuts with our last money. Then, through dry, dry lodge pole forest the rest of the day. Late afternoon we took a break, ate some gorp, and POW! The same stomach pains but no water within 4 miles to make milk with. I rolled in pain for what seemed an eternity and then they went just as fast as they came and I felt fine. Strange and very scary, I’ll call Laurie in Gov’t Camp.   Down a ridge to a spring to camp except the whole area just stunk of “death”. Getting late so we grabbed some water, purified just in case and took off down the trail to find a site without a smell. Well, the forest just got thicker and thicker as we dropped further down this ridge so out of desperation we just plopped our stuff down in the middle of the trail and camped in “jungle”. (Lodge pole forests here are so dense, with trees each just a few inches in diameter, spaced about two feet apart and branches intertwining right down the ground. Thus, the trail is literally cut out of the forest and is linear and there is absolutely nowhere for miles to step off of the trail!)
