Got a late start & proceeded to climb a canyon and then over Benson Pass (10,100’) in a single 2,500 ft bound. Ouch! on the legs. Had lunch & a game of cribbage in the bright warm sun on the pass. Thought we had a cake walk down to Benson Lake six miles away but due to mud, snow and generally bad, steep trail it took us a while and an effort. Benson Lake is fed by about 6 major canyons, each with its own creek/river. The trail happens to cross a valley where theses crisscross in a jungle-like waterland. It was the biggest confusion of water, mud, trees – dead and alive, grass, shrubs and 500,000 million mosquitoes. Needless to say it was a cross between an obstacle course and a survival test. Wild, wild, wild. I crossed more rivers today including one I jumped feet first into after losing my balance half way across a log, than I have in my entire life. We got thru and up into a valley above the floor of this canyon junction to camp overlooking the lake and incredible scenery. The words simply do not do the beauty justice. (This area of Yosemite is THE largest, roadless, and therefore arguably wildest area in California.)
