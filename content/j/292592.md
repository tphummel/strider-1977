A note on these entries; I have copied my journal from 1977 word for word, including miss-spellings and poor grammar to accurately reflect that stage in my life. Additionally, I have added memories that I did not put into my journal. In the Word document from which this is created, I put the original in italics and my recollections in plain text. Unfortunately, Trail Journals wont translate that. So, I have put my more recent memories into parentheses.
So sit back, grab a beer, and enjoy a slow rambling tale of a young, extremely tall dude, without a clue, who took on the world . . . and won.
