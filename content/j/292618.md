Slept in late and fixed myself a good breakfast. Snow is still at an inch but it has stopped. By the time I packed up and was ready to go it started snowing again. I waited a while and then decided to go. It snowed on me all the rest of the day light and hard. I only walked 6 miles before I camped. It really came down hard for a while. An inch and a half just while I walked. I’m camped at Long Canyon Creek in snow but I’m warm and dry so far. I still have seen no other PCTer’s in 3 days. The snow continues to fall incessantly.
