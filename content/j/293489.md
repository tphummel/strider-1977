Beautiful August at last. Weather has been clear and warm to hot since McKenzie Pass. Lodge pole forests seem to never end and still the water situation is sad. I suppose that’s the price we have to pay for no snow on the ground or rain in the sky. Lunch at a ranger station by Clackamas Lake where the kindly gave me an unused old P.C.T. diamond (trail sign). We walked a ways on to Timothy Lake for a swim in the shadow of “massive” Mt. Hood. Then, by numerous springs and cool clear wide Crater Creek and up to a small spring and campsite for the night. Two big guys there already are hiking Sth but just Oregon who had heard of “Strider” from the “Unfortunates” on a hike 2 weeks earlier in the Marble Mtns. Places to go back to; 3 Sisters, Mt. Thielsen, Mt. Jefferson, Marble Mtns. (Note to self!)
