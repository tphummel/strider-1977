I woke to find Paul beside me. He made it an hour and a half after me with a heavier pack, rashes, shorter legs and a blood blister on a heel the size of a silver dollar. He’s got guts. My shins and amazing stiffness and exhaustion are my only pains this morning. Paul also walked that last hour and a half by the light of his flash light. . . . probably mumbling to himself, “God damn it, Hummel, you’re not going to out walk me!” Well, today is what I call a 21½-mile layover day.   We won’t walk a single mile yet in 2 days we have averaged 21 ½ miles per day.    I went for a swim in the cool Odell Lake and it really woke up my muscles. A beautiful day for just sitting on a jetty in the sun.
