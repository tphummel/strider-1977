Woke up to a ½ inch of snow on the ground so we waited until 10:30 to work so that the snow would melt off. Worked hard in the cold until 5:00 and then called it quits. About an hour later the snow dropping and by dark there was an inch on the ground. Don, Scott and Kent all went into Kernville for the weekend and so did Joyce and Rubin, the foreman, leaving me with the trailer to sleep in tonight and plenty of food. Ramone, one of the Mexicans, found a baby rabbit today while working and gave it to Joyce, so he’s my company tonight. I made $50 and planted 2,000 trees in two days.
