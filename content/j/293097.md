Walked up to Park Hdqtrs and complained but to no avail. Left our packs there and walked up to the rim of Crater Lake and a lodge. It’s a beautiful day and the lake is incredible and very blue except we left our cameras in our packs. We’ll be hiking around the rim tomorrow tho. Met Claire & Joy again and arranged to stay in their campsite and split the cost at Mazama Camp. Met a bunch of P.C.T.ers that started at Echo Lake (California). They report that the section Paul & I skipped by going up I-5 was beautiful. I’ll have to return someday. (Note to self!) Sat at the lodge all afternoon and then hitched back down to our packs and the campground. After dinner we heard some guys pickin’ and a singin’ so we went to investigate and found 3 guys our age from Connecticut with a 12 string guitar, a wash board and a harmonica going at it. Paul plays the guitar so we added some songs and tunes and had a great time. Pretty soon we even had an audience. We really had fun. We went to a campfire, Ranger style, afterward and heard all about the history of the park along with a slide show.
