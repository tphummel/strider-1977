The blackberries were GREAT! We walked the road to Carson and then a guy who had put up Ryback (Eric Ryback, who hiked north to south in 1971 and wrote a inspirational book about it) offered us a ride to Panther Creek Rd. so we took it. Walked up to a campground for lunch and then up to the last place where Road N605 crosses Panther Creek and sat for an hour while it poured rain on us. It cleared up quickly but left extremely high humidity in the air. Camped in a terrible spot â€“ just a turnout on the road.
