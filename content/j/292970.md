My stomach still feels upset but I walk on any way. Early morning I ran into Pierre and his girlfriend who have been traveling for 6 years straight by any means they can find. Presently by camper. Sth America, Central, Mexico, North Am., Canada, etc. Real nice and lots of stories. Anyhow, I hiked on Hwy 89 as far north as it would take me and then hitched by Mount Shasta and south to Castella, with a guy who’s into “polar” massage. Got my food drop & Fred’s package and went and crashed in a picnic area right beside the Sacramento River. Very low. Fred’s package contained a Swiss Army Knife, since Bill’s old one I have recently broke, a small bottle of wine, 2 chocolate bars, a booklet on the stars and an excellent book on the wildlife and plants of the Cascades. A great B-day package!! Finally met Claire & Joy & their two dogs also in this campground. They’ve been ahead of me since Tahoe. I killed the wine with dinner, took a walk to find Paul, had no luck so I called it a day.
