Up early and I packed a lunch and some water and off I go through green meadows and wild flowers to the base of Middle Sister.   All 3 Sisters are glaciated volcanoes so volcanic ash, pumice and obsidian abound. Mostly loose rock-boulder scrambling and climbing all the way u in just a few hours. Magnificent view; to the north, North Sister, Mt. Washington, 3 Fingered Jack, Mt. Jefferson, Mt. Hood and one I could just barely outline(?). To the south; South Sister, Broken Top, Diamond Peak, Mt. Thielsen and Mt. McLoughlin. I signed in and 4 guys joined me on top. They were going to climb Nth Sister also today! The clouds were starting to form right over our heads out of nowhere so I headed back down and surprisingly got back to camp around noon. So I took a cool swim, fed my face and then just walked around this paradise without a care in the world on a BEAUTIFUL day. Later that afternoon a couple stopped by and joined me for the night. A quote from the register on top of Middle Sister: “Whoever invented mountains had the right idea!”
