Woke up to SUNSHINE!! Yea! Everything is drying out and the sky is blue. There are beautiful peaks and snow capped ridges on three sides of us. Nice view. (I recall waking to the recently unusual sound of the sides of my tent flapping in a light breeze, only able to make this noise because they were DRY! When I poked my head out the incredible panorama of the north Cascades made my mouth drop open in awe. Finally, sunshine!) Dropped around glacier-laden Kennedy (Glacier?)Peak and way down to the Suiattle River for lunch (an extremely wild and beautiful river and valley). Hot enough for shorts and t-shirt climbing up over Suiattle Pass past copper mines. Beautiful day although clouds are building up again this evening. Camped a mile north of the pass beside Agnes Creek.
