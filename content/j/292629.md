Another morning colder than hell so I didn’t get off until late. Big blue sky to begin with but once again it slowly got overcast and then cloudy and then snowed later in the evening. Kearsarge Pass (11,832’) was a bitch. Snow 2-3 feet and a cold strong wind didn’t help any. I met the first people I’ve seen in over a week; 4 guys who are fishing in the lakes on Onion Valley side of Kearsarge. I got down to Onion Valley parking lot to find 2 cars; 1 is the 4 guys and the other belongs to a girl who just started out for 6 days. So I will stay in a run down, broken into shack tonight. A car with an elderly couple came up but they only had room for me or my pack but not both and I missed another car. My food is low, my spirits are low, I’m tired and I just want to get the hell out of the mountains and snow for a few days. It’s taken me over two weeks to do what I had planned for one.
