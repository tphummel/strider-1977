Right as I was ready to leave this morning up walks a stranger, Jim, who is just doing a piece of the P.C.T. & came in at Ebbets Pass. He happens to want to hike the same mileages I do so off we went. His pace is compatible with mine (this is vital in long distance hiking as following someone who walks too slow tires you and trying to keep up with someone who walks too fast does the same thing!) so we did 11 miles before lunch and 11 miles after to put us just a few miles past Tamarack Flat, which also serves as a cow pasture. Water is very scarce but every thing is green. Still walking purely on dirt roads. The country looks pretty dull, just a lot of trees (and no overviews, scenic mountains, big creeks or rivers or lakes). Hot, hot but nowhere to swim. Tomorrow at Hartman Bar for lunch though. We want to get to Belden by the 27th.
