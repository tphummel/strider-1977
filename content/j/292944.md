Up and out to Highway 50 and hitched into South Lake Tahoe to find there are four post offices here! Found the main one and met Beth and went to lunch. Hung around the P.O. all afternoon and then found Fred at a different P.O.. Jay and Beth left for their drive back to Idaho and work and Fred & I went to a movie; “Carie” which was a disappointment. (A disappointment as it is a scary movie and we were hoping for a more uplifting one, considering where I was coming from and going to.) Dinner and then sacked out in F’s van in a campground. (South Lake Tahoe is the largest town essentially on the trail and thus, in summer, with all of the tourists, casinos, malls, traffic, etc. is rather overwhelming to a thru-hiker.)
