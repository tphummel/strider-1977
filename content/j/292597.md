Walked only about ten miles to try to let my blisters heal. Again alone in a campground. Didn’t do a whole lot today. The wind is blowing and it’s very cold. I’m going to try to get a lot of sleep tonight and go 22 miles tomorrow. Acton by Saturday possibly. I’m not feeling real good. Perhaps this was a touch of loneliness as there was no one else around this section. I guess my high mileage days left a pack behind. The cold wind was coming across the higher ridges of the San Gabriel Mountains and the remnant snow there. What I didn’t mention was that the ten miles I did hike was all up from Wrightwood into the San Gabriel’s. The San Jacinto , San Bernardino and San Gabriel Mountains were the mountains that I had hiked in while in the Boy Scouts growing up. I know these mountains well and had stood upon the summits of all of the high peaks; San Jacinto, San Gorgonio, Mt. Baden Powell, Old Baldy, etc. in my teenage years.
