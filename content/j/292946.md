Breakfast, laundry, shopping, P.O. and packing and up to Echo Summit and off all before 12:00.   We are going into the Desolation Wilderness. Nice, but a lot of people. Hiked up and away from them and decided to go up Rockbound Valley over Mosquito Pass instead of PCT. Both places earn their names well. Mosquitoes are hideous at a beautiful camp near some great cascades below the Pass. End of Fred’s first day. 
In a letter to home I wrote: “Hi, I’m doing just fine, Jay & I had a great time except for his blisters. We got to Sth Lake Tahoe in 10 days (6/1277) and met Fred and Beth. Today F & I leave for Belden. Plan to be there in 14 days, so 6/27 to 629 approximately. I can stay at Milo’s (USSB basketball booster) next year, please send me his address along with; $50, mosquito repellant, 2 cans of gas, 4 dinners, prunes, one of my lightweight, long sleeve, button front shirts, a little Woolite. Dad, could you find me one of our working casting fishing reels and send it? Thanx! We got some good solid rain for a week. Beautiful country, Nth Yosemite. I got pre-registration packet, thanx. What is the situation with health insurance when I turn 21? It’s really nice hiking with brothers. I finally discovered what they’re good for! My feet & body are in fine shape. Feeling good, see you later, luv Greg.
