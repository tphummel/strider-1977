Wrote a bunch of letters and waited for the Post Office to open. It rained for a while yesterday believe it or not and it rained this morning too. ( Believe it or not as it is summer and very, very hot here.) Nothing heavy enough to gather. Walked the road following Hat Creek as it winds down a wide volcanic lava strewn valley. Not too bad of a walk but the logging trucks scare the shit out of me. Camped at Honn Campground once again next to Hat Creek with a pesky family right next to me. Beautiful farms and lots of fields, green, green. Only 15 miles today because itâ€™s only 15 to Burney where I want to get to for the 4th July weekend to meet the Unfortunates. The trail all along this section has no water so Hwy 89 is the route.
