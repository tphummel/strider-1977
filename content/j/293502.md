Hitched a ride into Packwood west on U.S. 12 for supplies and then up to Paradise Lodge to find Duane Wyman for lunch. He works in the bar here and has a room he shares with 2 others, Ted Unkles and Jim. We put our stuff in the room and talked to Ted while Duane had to work. It appears Duane and Ted can provide us with ice axes, crampons, ropes, harnesses and a full briefing on “the” mountain about how to go about it. TOMORROW! We start up the mountain to Muir Camp at 10,000 feet and then to the summit the next morning. I can’t believe it! It went from so many “ifs” to yes you can if you can physically. Talked to Duane and his friends til late at night and slept there the night. (The talks all night were, of course, about the many, many stories and adventures that we had accumulated in the past approximately 2,000 miles of walking.)
