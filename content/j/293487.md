Yes today we finally passed Mt. Jefferson and some real nice areas and scenes. Unfortunately it’s Sunday and there are hordes of people here also. Jefferson Park is beautiful, called a park cause it looks just like it could be one. At lunch at Russel Creek we found a bunch of raspberries(!) so we mixed them in with a vanilla pudding, topped it with graham cracker crumbs and had the best treat on the trail. Over a ridge to face 50-mile distant Mt. Hood and encounter our first snow crossing since the Sierras. Down to Breitenbush Lake to camp along with 50 million RV campers but had a good talk with a guy who used to work in a backpacking store. I don’t think I mentioned that back at McKenzie Pass I saw llamas grazing on a farm when we drove out to Sisters.    My dream is to own one as a pet and hiking partner one day! (Note to self!)
