Today was nearly as hard as when I did 32 miles. 22 miles today, but a gain of 5,000 feet in altitude. I went all of the way from desert to pines and snow today. 3,000 feet of it was in the last six miles. I’m pretty tired. Feet are holding up pretty well though. Beautiful wildflowers in desert today. Began hot, very hot and then clouds came over in the afternoon as the climb became serious. The weather is threatening now with high winds and darkening clouds. The winds kept me up most of that night. I may go all of the 23 miles into Big Bear tomorrow since it’s mostly flat or down hill. Camping by myself again tonight, at least so far. Getting lonely and need someone to talk to, preferably female. Moon is a sliver.
