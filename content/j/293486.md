Up early but a long easy breakfast at the trailhead. A long gradual climb up to 3 Fingered Jack and a walk in its shadow. Lunch at Wasco Lake and then a long, long walk to a small creek a mile south of Shale Lakes. Arrived at sun down and had eaten dinner before Paul came in. My stomach all of a sudden began giving me incredible ulcer-like pains for unknown reasons, so I drank some milk and they slowly subsided. These pains were so intense that they doubled me up on the ground and scared the dickens out of me. Lots of people before lunch but none after. The trail was very dry and just ran along a monotonous ridge bringing us ever closer to nice looking Mt. Jefferson.
