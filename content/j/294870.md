4 days to GO! We are trying to just do 15 miles/day since Stehekin. It rained during the night but stopped after breakfast. Unstable looking though until lunch at Brush Creek where it was hot. Paul’s stove is acting up from some bad fuel he put in it at the miner’s cabin. A long hot and cold climb up to Glacier Pass and more up over a ridge at about 6,700 feet to a good camp tucked back in against a peak. Met a fellow named, Eric Grey, who is walking anywhere and everywhere around the Nth Cascades for 3 months. He has been out 1 ½ so far. (May visit me in Santa Barbara – never did) Threatening weather persists.
