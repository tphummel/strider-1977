No rain this morning so we packed up our wet things and took off on a beautiful section of the permanent P.C.T. thru volcanic outcroppings with fungus (most likely lichen) on it that looked like spray paint. Nice vistas to Markleeville and down to Pleasant Valley. Everything fresh & green after this Spring shower. Rained on us this afternoon before we stopped at a tiny lake to fish and then on to Blue Lakes for 18 miles today.   Dried out our things in the late afternoon perfect blue sky.
