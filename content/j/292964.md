My legs feel very sore this morning, I guess because Iâ€™m pushing. Hiked up to Hwy 89 and on to Summit Lake for lunch. Early afternoon was an easy walk and then the trail disappeared and the cross-country began and I proceeded to walk for 6 straight hours on lumber roads preying that around the next corner there flowed any kind of water. I finally made my way to Hwy 89 at Old Station, had a beer and collapsed. Camped right next to Hat Creek and the roaring of the highway.
