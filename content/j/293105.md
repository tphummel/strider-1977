Clear skies again this morning, I’ll bet it rains this afternoon. Hiking up in elevation finally brought us relief from the mosquitoes, before lunch. Early afternoon I win my bet but it only sprinkles as finally we sight and walk around South Sister. Fields and beautiful meadows of lupine, wild flowers, trickling streams and a beautiful (by this time the reader must be getting tired of this term; “beautiful”, but so many of the incredible natural scenes, sights and views cannot be easily described in simple words) clear lake-let that has Middle Sister dominating it. We camp here tonight in this incredible beauty and then tomorrow Paul will go on to Santiam Pass in two days and I will stay and climb Middle Sister (10,047’) and then meet Paul, after his visit with a sister from Eugene, on Thursday night.
