The sun came out and melted the snow down to 6 inches this morning before the big black clouds came over this afternoon. So far they haven’t dropped anything and I hope the same for tonight. I dug out and organized all the food I’ll need to get me to Independence and left a note & $10 to cover what I’ve eaten and taken from the trailer. I snow sealed my boots and dried out clothing but nowhere is there a large enough spot to dry out my tent. Not much to do and I’m getting depressed being on my own. I’m very tired of this solitude.
