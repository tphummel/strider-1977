We said goodbye and they headed back and I headed northward again and reached the West Nelson Creek for lunch. I met 2 girls and a guy who started at Sierra City. They gave me a bunch of candy because they had plenty and wanted to be known as the “candy dollies”. O.K. These were very attractive young women and a dorky-looking guy. All were very strange and I even berated them for bringing only candy to eat on a backpacking trip.   Later on I got misled by wrongly placed P.C.T. blazes and found myself cross-countrying over a ridge to get back on the right track. Camped off of the Quincy-La Porte road. Dirt roads have been the trail for the last 2 days, what a drag. It’s getting much drier and water is slowly becoming scarce, and the weather is slowly becoming hotter and hotter, blue skies persist. 20 miles today.
