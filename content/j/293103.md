Up early so we can get in a lot of miles and happy to find that it never rained last night. Said our goodbyes and took off into what we hear is terrible mosquito country. During lunch at beautiful Rosary Lakes the clouds once again came over and threatened. We played dodge the storm until mid-afternoon when it caught us and rained mildly for over an hour. Our still recovering muscles could only take us to pleasant but mosquito infested Charlton Lake. The clouds cleared in the evening and the wind cleared the mosquitoes.
