We dropped down off of the slopes of Adams and aimed our sights towards the jagged ridge called Goat Rocks. A dull day through dry lodge pole and pumice flats and then a slow hot climb up to a lake 5058’ near Coleman Weedpatch. The rocks look real nice. (hmm, what a boring thing to say from this perspective when a much more detailed description the “real nice” rocks would be so much more interesting!) Mt. Rainier keeps showing its face here and there and calling me to climb it. I hope we can since we are going to try to find an earlier PCT hiker who works at Paradise Lodge in Rainier Nat. Park who can supposedly arrange it.
