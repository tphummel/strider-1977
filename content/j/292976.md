Up real early and on the road before the sun was up and heat began. Feeling sick probably from drinking water from the reservoir. ( 1977 was THE driest year on record for several decades and the reservoirs were incredibly low, concentrating the infectious content and making for the “runs” as a consequence of drinking.) Crossed the border before noon and celebrated a bit. “ORE” is the only marker. Quite a let down but also quite an accomplishment. A lot of pain, frustration, joy, happiness, failure, success, etc., etc. since Campo. Only 900 miles to go!! Hell. This morning we saw many, many birds on the water such as Great Blue Heron, Sea Gulls, Ducks, Grebes, Hawks, all types of small birds and most impressive of all White-with-black-wing-tips-great-pelicans. Feeling really bad this afternoon like nauseous and a fever so we hitched to a roadside spring & camp and I went to sleep all afternoon. (On the California side it was dry, hot and brutal. Just twenty yards into Oregon we found ourselves in a cool meadow filled with flowers and a small stream. The change from CA to ORE was just amazing!)
