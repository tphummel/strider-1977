Ramona Falls were first on the trail today. Beautiful cascading white over basaltic columns covered in deep green moss. Overrun though so no camping. A lot of people on the trail yesterday around the lodge but few today. Having Jeff with us is a nice change!    By the way, Laurie said, when I called her at Gov’t Camp that it was either ulcers or stomach inflation and to coat it! All right, so I picked up some stuff and now that I’m ready for it, nothing is wrong. Met a crew doing a fine job maintaining the trail. P.C.T. is highest maintained trail in Oregon. A long walk along a lush green crest looking back on the Northwest side of Hood. Massive mountain! Growth beside trail was so thick in places it came up to my armpits and totally covered trail.   Entered Bull Run Reserve and met a sign; “Entering Bull Run Reserve, For the Next 10 Miles it is a Violation of Federal Law to Leave the Pacific Crest Trail.” What a threat! The reserve is the watershed for Portland and there are big court squabbles cause the city wants it completely closed so the water won’t be polluted. Eagle Creek, which we will hike through tomorrow, is also in it. Camped at Indian Springs Camp and found loads of wild huckleberries, like blue berries for pancakes tomorrow morning.
