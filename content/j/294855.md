I can’t believe the extent of the clear cutting. You can see it spread for miles and miles.   In the clear cuts though only one thing good is brought about and that is the huckleberries, BIG & RIPE! Just walk along and pluck ‘em into your mouth. We stopped for lunch at a weather station near Stampede Pass and some people picking berries there gave us some homemade cookies & bread & a little cheese. Yum. Forecast is continued hot & dry and boy is it! Onward through clear cuts all day and then finally back into virgin forest to beautiful Mirror Lake for a warm, refreshing swim and camp. We met another Nth – Sth – just Washington-stater today. (The incredible huckleberry bushes lined each side of the trail to over our heads. We tucked a paper bag into our belt and began plucking one, two in the bag, one in the mouth, one, two in the bag and another one in the mouth. The next morning, huckleberries in pancakes, for lunch huckleberries in a no-bake cheese cake. Yum!)
