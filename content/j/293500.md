Climbed all morning until we finally crossed Cispus Pass to view Goat Rocks, which actually lays on Indian Land. Beautiful area, we even had lunch at a 20 ft. waterfall. Thru meadows and wildflowers up to the highest point on the Washington PCT and across the Packwood Glacier onto a very precarious ridge that dropped off immediately from both sides of the trail. Down on a terrible trail to McCall Basin for camp tonight.
