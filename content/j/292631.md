I got off real early cause it wasn’t cold at all. I walked to a rest area for lunch about 10 miles down the road that had a beautiful stream running thru it. The long road on a hot day just really depressed me but I got all the way to Big Pine; 26 miles! I can’t feel my toes at all, they’re all totally numb (First stage of frost bite. The feeling returned in all but two later. The feeling returned in the final two in about 2001) They have been that way a week. I don’t know if it’s cause of the snow or just from all of the walking asphalt all day. I think I’ve pulled the muscles in my lower back also. (I did this commonly in basketball for years thru highschool and college) The Backtrackers came into Big Pine just about an hour after me and they had been thru a lot of hell too and had hitchhiked out from Cedar Grove and were on their way back to Taboose Pass.
