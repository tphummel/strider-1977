It sprinkled rain during the night, but blue skies in the morning. It was raining again tho by the time I got my mail, bought our food supplies and hopped back on the shuttle bus ($1.00). Up to Bridge Creek where we had lunch and remet a couple we met up Agnes Creek yesterday. We all headed up the canyon after the rain stopped for an old minerâ€™s cabin about 10 miles in. I received a card from the Blazers and Chairman from Snoqualmie Pass saying they will arrive here in Stehekin, today, the 2nd, so we left them notes everywhere hoping they will catch us in the next few days and we can all cross the border together. It rained most the night.
