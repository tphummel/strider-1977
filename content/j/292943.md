Blue sky and warm this morning to hike the 7 miles out to Highway 88 then up to Carson Pass and over a ridge for an outrageous view Nth to Lake Tahoe;, big, blue, and quite a ways away. Dropped dow to some lakes and then across patchy snow in the afternoon down to Bryan Meadow and a camp right next to 300 million frogs!
