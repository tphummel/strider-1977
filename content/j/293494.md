Woke up real early and went across the Bridge of the Gods and the Oregon – Washington border. Oregon was a disappointment in that we thought we’d find a lot more flowing water and areas like Eagle Creek. Some definitely nice places but very spread out and very dull in between. Northern 1/3 was generally nice. Ah, Washington at last, the final leg. Checked into a motel there in Stevenson, bought groceries, got our mail, did some laundry, and then sat down and watched sports on T.V. all afternoon. Paul and I went out and picked at least a gallon of fresh, ripe, luscious, blackberries for breakfast tomorrow. Fred didn’t reply to me here with respect to meeting me at White Pass so I guess I play it by ear. I got a couple cards from the Trailblazers and the Chairman. They say they are just behind us and aiming for Sept. 8th for Canada. We are aiming for the 7th so maybe we can get together.
