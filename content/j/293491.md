Up and over to the P.O. and YES! The money came. Sent a big box home and then bought some needed supplies. A small dog came up to me as I left the store and he had porcupine needles stuck in his nose. Paul held him and I plucked them out but not without a lot of yelping. Poor thing. Up to big Timberline Lodge for a lunch in their restaurant and then we walked our way around Hood past lovely creeks and impressive erosional canyons. Camped at Scout Camp and heard there are no South-bound-entire-P.C.T.ers.
