I got up slowly and fixed breakfast as I watched the clouds roll over and the temperature drop. Across lava beds of AA lava (Ah Ah) with cold, strong winds and alternating mist and rain.    Eerie scene. Trail across the lava was terrible, like walking on fist sized, loose rocks. Drab day. I came to Santiam Presbyterian Lodge where I heard hikers can get a bed, shower, and meal for a minimal donation and where Paul and I agreed to meet. Very friendly people showed me to a dorm-like setup so I showered and then went upstairs to the lounge and just sat by the fireplace and attempted to read with 30 babbling, screaming kids in a “camp” there. Paul arrived late afternoon after I had dinner with the Reverend and so he settled in. Then it’s time for Volleyball!!   Everybody out! Paul and I played on the girls side to make it even and interesting and we had a real fun time. Amazing as it may seem we actually got some peace and quiet to sleep by. (in 2009 I received an email from a woman planning to hike the PCT and seeking information. She said her father had run the Santiam Prebyterian Lodge from the mid '70's to the mid '80's. He had remembered "this really tall guy named "Strider" and urged her to see if she could find me. She Googled it and found me!)
