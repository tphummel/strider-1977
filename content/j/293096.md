Hiked by lovely dry but green grassy and wild flowery fields this morning. Had lunch just before the “Oregon Desert” getting our water from a barely flowing stream. On through fields of great smelling lupine but very dry forest all the way to Anne Springs just at the base of Crater Lake within the park’s boundary. 24 miles total! One problem, when in this national park, you can’t camp within one mile of any road, so in the middle to the night, just before hitting the sack, up walks a ranger and says “Move or take a $25 fine.” We didn’t happen to have $25 that we wanted to give to this bastard so we had to completely pack up and walk another mile in the pitch black. We were pretty mad at this ranger for enforcing a regulation that is aimed at preventing motorists from camping along side the road and not P.C.T.ers who have just walked 24 miles! Well, as they say, there is no government like no government.
