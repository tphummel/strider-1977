5 miles to Rainy Pass but fortunately it didn’t live up to its name. An easy gradient climb up to Cutthroat Pass and some real nice peaks around for lunchtime views. Then an easy walk along the side of a perfect “U” shaped glacial valley to a nice and perfect camp in a basin below the Snow Lakes. Gin Rummy and food and sleep.
