Hiked up Jack Main Canyon 10 miles before lunch. In those 10 miles we climbed to 9600’ very constantly & thus quickly. Over Dorothy Lake Pass and decided we will go to Leavit Meadows to avoid an unnecessary altitude gain & excessive mileage on the P.C.T. to Highway 108. Dropped down steep jagged rock ledges by gushing Cascade Creek into a lush forested valley & then following the West Walker River past incredibly green meadows & a few wild flowers. Beautiful valley, quaking aspen beginning to appear more. Jay’s feet are pretty bad, lots & lots of blisters but he is feeling good physically (Foolish Jay! Anyone who tries to hike a section with someone who has already hiked more than 800 miles is just asking for it! Jay and I had always been competitive growing up and I think Jay just couldn’t let his little brother out walk him!) Me? I’m feeling stronger and my feet are healing beautifully. Camped by a creek feeding Walker (River).
