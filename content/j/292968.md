Paul and Nancy are going to walk Hwy 89 to Hwy 5 at Shasta City. Paul will meet me in Castella Friday and then we’ll walk up Hwy 5 until we meet the Oregon Skyline Trail. I’m laying over here today with the Unforts to celebrate my 21st B-day and to wait for Joe to return. Fished this morning but no luck. (All of the people here appeared to weigh about 350 pounds!) Went swimming in Lake Briton and just lazed around. Tom and Steve went into Burney this afternoon to pick up their resoled boots. Joe got a message to us that his still in Sth Lake Tahoe and will take a bus to Redding manana and hitchhike to here. I can’t wait another day as I promised Paul I’d meet him in Castella on Friday. Just sat around a fire and drank peach brandy and talked with Tom & Steve tonight.
