Checked into a small hotel in the R.R. town of Skykomish and had breakfast in their café. Dried all of our wet clothes and my sleeping bag in a Laundromat down the road. (I recall taking off all of my clothes except a pair of shorts, pulling out all of my gear and literally dumping everything else into a drier and plugging in the quarters. I found a small piece of towel and, as my Levi jeans were worn through on the tops of my thighs from constantly wiping me hands there, I sewed a patch of terry cloth over the holes in both legs AND provided a great way to dry my hands. Unfortunately, the rain didn’t give it a chance. These days, wearing cotton Levi’s in the cold, wet Pacific Northwest would be considered insane!) Stopped at a Salmon fish hatchery and a backpacking store to buy some rain pants for Paul. Lunch and then packing and talking with Rob Blacker until he left. Rain is never ceasing. A nice hot bath in an old fashion tub was my pleasure tonight. Called parents and made final arrangements for Manning Park.
