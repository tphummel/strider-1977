The mosquitoes came our early and plagued us all the way to lunch. They subsided though as we climbed above the wet, flat forest. But the altitude brought a water shortage with it and we had to go most of the afternoon without, until believe it or not we found a patch of snow at about 7300 feet at this time of year!! We met a couple at lunch hiking the trail from Oregon on, who are from England, in the U.S. for 6 months on the trail for 3 months. Really nice people. The wondered if all of Oregon was just rolling forests crammed with mossies. The area is very rolling and green with plenty of nice stagnant lakes to breed mossies in. Camped just below Lee Pk. And Devils Pk. at some nice fresh springs. Mosquitoes are a lot more scarce here tonight.
