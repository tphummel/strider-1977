Hiked the 6-8 miles to Lequit Meadows before noon & found ourselves in the middle of a Marine Camp and some rude comments. (“Where are you hiking to – from?” When I answer “Mexico – Canada” they said “Bullshit” I tried to convince them briefly that I had indeed walked from the Mexican border so far, but they just couldn’t get their minds around this.) We hitched a ride west on Highway 108 to Dardanelles to get supplies. The rain started won as we got there so we had to wait around for it to let up a little. Jay called Beth (his girlfriend at the time and now wife) and I called Edd (Schofield; a lifetime friend and early hiking partner in the Sierra in high school and college); Beth is fine & will meet Jay in Sth Lake Tahoe, Edd can’t come in until at least Belden. Prospects for rides back to Leavitt Meadows didn’t look good so we hiked up the Clark Fork of the Stanislaus going by some incredible falls under a bridge and after a long road walk thru thick green forest we camped right next to the river. We buried our food tonight under heavy rocks (to keep the varmints away).
