I woke up to a very burnt face and aching muscles.   I found a days worth of food here in a can, so I’m going to lay over and heal my ails. Another beautiful day. Around lunch I changed my mind and decided to hike the first 6 or 7 miles of the 15 I wanted to do tomorrow. It was mostly up hill so that makes tomorrow much easier. I’m camped at Whitney Creek at a beautiful spot. Some clouds are appearing here and there and one even dropped snow for about 5 minutes. I’m feeling stronger slowly but the altitude still kills me going up hill. Yesterday morning when I started off thru Tunnel Meadow the snow reflecting the morning sun looked just like icing with speckles on it glittering brightly off the crystals. Tomorrow I go to the base of Forester Pass and then over it and to Kearsarge Pass the next day. I feel much better this evening then I did last. Its amazing how being tired can really bring you down. Of course a few other happenings yesterday didn’t help. Prey for good weather.
