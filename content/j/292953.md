I never put a shirt on this morning until I put my pack on. The sun is just fired up but clouds are still prominent. Almost totally gradual downhill all the way to lunch. The rain, lightning and thunder came over and dropped very heavily for an hour before we crossed the Jackson Meadow Reservoir Dam. (At one point the ozone raised our hair and caused the telltale smell that lightning was imminent. Then “CCCRRRAAAACCCKKK!!!!!” and a tree about 50 yards from us burst into flames! We worried that a forest fire might chase us, but the heavy rain quickly knocked the flames down.) The reservoir was nearly empty because of the drought. Hiked on down to Milton Reservoir to camp and found that the fish, catfish, were all belly up and stone dead. The rain stopped and the sky semi cleared in the most beautiful arrangement of clouds I’ve ever seen. We came out and enjoyed the evening and fished jus for the hell of it and Fred caught a dead fish by the gill. That put an end to the fishing for the day! 8 miles to Sierra City tomorrow to meet Matt Fisher (a friend of Fred’s).
