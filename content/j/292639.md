I woke up late and sore but the day beckoned me to leave. I got off by noon and walked and hitchhiked to the trailhead at Horseshoe Lake to go over Mammoth Pass. It was only four miles to Reds Meadow but my body felt like week old socks, very stiff. The snow is about a foot deep at 9,000 feet but melting. There’s a new storm expected tomorrow and the same for 2 weeks. I got in Reds Meadow mid-afternoon and found the Unfortunates and so we all too a bath in the hot springs even though it snowed a little. I’m camped with them at Devil’s Postpile right next to the full and rushing San Joaquin River. To Thousand Island Lake manana.
