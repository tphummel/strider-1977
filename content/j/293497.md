Got a real early start and got within striking distance of Mt. Adams by hiking 18 miles to Trout Lake Creek, nice campsite. Late afternoon we met a “Bill Foster” hiking Nth to Sth the entire PCT, for the second time! First time in ’71 – ’72 south to north. This time he is hiking North to South then West to East across the U.S. and the South to North on the Appalachian Trail, which he has also done before as the Northern U.S. East to West. (thus he was attempting to hike a complete circumnavigation of the U.S. I never heard if he succeeded.) A really nice guy, but a fanatic. 2 ½ years for this trip! Grasshoppers all over today.
