I decided to go ahead of Nancy and the Blazers and so my food wouldn’t run out, try to make Independence early. I hiked about 5 miles when I came over a pass into Osa Meadows to find it completely burnt out by a fire a year and a half ago. There is a couple trailers and a car sitting there and some people working up on the burnt area. To make a long story short they are planting trees, Jeffrey Pines and the pay is $5/hour and they, or she, the contractor, Joyce, is short of workers. So here I am after working 7 hours planting trees and being fed very well. I figure I can use the money and as long as Joyce is feeding me it is no food out of my pack. Ken, Don, Rick, Scott, me and 3 Mexicans are working for her. 8 foot spacing and 13 trees to a plot (16 foot radius). Joyce has also given me extra food for my pack. The guys are nice, the work is hard, the food is good and I will work tomorrow too if it doesn’t rain or snow tonight. I never saw the people behind me today. Clouds blew over all day and threaten constantly. My arms and hands are sore but it’s a nice break for my blisters.(I still have the receipt from working for Joyce.
