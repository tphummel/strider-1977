A lot cooler today but the blue skies persist and cooler is 75 to 85 degrees. Climbed up all morning to enter Lassen National Forest and then flat until I tried one of my famous “shortcuts”. It cost me a few hours, a lot of energy and losing Jim. Finally I found my way and got to where we planned to; Carter Meadows. Just my luck, there’s no water in Carter Creek so I had to purify water sitting in the meadow. No fun today; all I did was walk, eat and sweat. 25 miles though, more counting cross-country “short-cuts”.
