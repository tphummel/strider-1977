Got up and had eggs & sausage for breakfast and then started off down the trail following the now ever more impressive Tuolumne River for a while and then turning off and climbing the rest of the day. The new pack is great but it rubs in new places and I’m not used to the padded belly band and I think I’m carrying about 70 – 75 lbs. (A thru-hiker embarking on this section of the trail today would likely be considered to be carrying WAY too much if his/her pack weighed even half of this!) We camped at Miller Lake, a good 16 miler. No mosquitoes here but plenty while we walked today. We hung our food with some hassle and then went fishing. Surely as a pro Jay pulled out five thirteen inch trout within an hour. We forgot the margarine this morning so they cooked in their own juices and tasted great for dinner. Jay saved one for breakfast but in the morning something had dragged it away out of the stream (that we had left it tied into to keep cold and hopefully to suppress the smell from foraging animals. Ha!).
